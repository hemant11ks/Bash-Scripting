Bash Scripting:

What is Bash?
Bash stands for Bourne-Again SHell. It's an enhanced version of the original Bourne shell (sh) and is the default shell for most Unix-like operating systems. It acts as a bridge between the user and the operating system, allowing you to execute commands, manage files, and run programs from a command-line interface.

The Purpose of Bash Scripts
Bash scripts are used to automate repetitive or complex tasks. Instead of typing the same sequence of commands repeatedly, you can write them into a script and run it with a single command. This is useful for things like:

System administration: Automating backups, monitoring system performance, and managing users.

Software development: Compiling code, running tests, and deploying applications.

File management: Renaming, moving, or deleting large numbers of files.

Data processing: Parsing log files or processing data from different sources.

How to Write a Bash Script
A basic Bash script is a plain text file with a .sh extension. The first line of the script is called the shebang, which tells the operating system which interpreter to use for the script. For Bash, the shebang is #!/bin/bash.
